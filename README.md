# ðŸ“Œ bash

Sometimes we need to work with remote servers that don't have any graphic interface. In this case it's good to be able to use bash commands. They allow us to perform regular actions such as creating, editing, deleting files and folders via CLI. 

I am happy to share some bash commands that I used to do tasks during my Quality Assurance studies.
